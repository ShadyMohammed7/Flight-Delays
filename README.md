# Loan Data Exploration

## Dataset

This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan,
including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others

## Summary of Findings

In Conclusion, we have deduced that people need to pay the greatest attention to their prosper score,
as when it increases APR decreases.
Another thing to consider is to have a higher income range if your score is 8 or lower,
if your prosper score is 9 or 10 the best APR you will get is when your income is between 1 and 24,999 USD.
Make sure to have a low Debt to income ratio to get the best APR possible.
Your stated monthly income plays a role in the APR you get as well, the higher the monthly income you state 

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I have focused on the influence of Debt to Income ratio, Income range, Prosper Score
and Stated monthly salary and their effect on the Borrower APR.

I look at the distribution of each variable to be able to extract some useful insights,
then I looked at the categorical and discrete variables to see their distribution as well.
What we found in the bivariate correlations was interesting especially regarding the relation
between Prosper score vs APR and Income Range vs APR, which brings us to question the relation
between the 3 variables together and so we did.
